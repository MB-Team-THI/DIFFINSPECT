Latent Space Visualization Tool:
- Visualize various versions of latent embedding spaces (e.g. different dimensionality reduction methods)
- Visualize various labels (based on the description, color array, and label)
- Visualize the original content behind each latent via an image

However, one limitation is that the databases must be the same within one project. For example, it is not possible to make a first visualization of the training set and a second visualization of the test set, as the underlying images are always the same.

Visualization Tool based on:
  - Embedding explorer: https://github.com/GrantCuster/umap-explorer
  - Publications of Jonas Wurst: https://jwthi.github.io/SCENATLAS/ 
  - Instructions to create a GitHub Page: https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages
